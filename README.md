Answer for the questions:

I am planning to add an ImageButton of a pencil in the "row_todo_item.xml".

1. how easy is it for users to figure out this flow in their first usage?
It is very easy to figure out this flow because it is like the ImageButton I added for deleting item.
The picture is well known ans simple.

2. how hard to implement will your solution be?
It is nor had at all. Like I mentioned in the previous question it is like adding the deleting ImageButton.
The only difference is that in here we need to click on the item and also to insert a text to edit.

3. how consistent is this flow with regular "edit" flows in the Android world?
It is very consistent. Most of the solutions I know are using the pencil ImageButton because
it is the very well-known solution for this task. Moreover, I found the image in the Android Studio folder
under the title 'edit'.
